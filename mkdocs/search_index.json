            "text": "Between Adventures\n\n\nBetween trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.  \n\nIn some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion. \n\n\nLifestyle Expenses\n\n\nBetween adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.  \n\nLiving a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty. \n\n\nDowntime Activities\n\n\nBetween adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.  \n\nDowntime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM. \n\n\nCrafting\n\n\nYou can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.  \n\nFor every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.  \n\nMultiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.  \n\nWhile crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost. \n\n\nPracticing a Profession\n\n\nYou can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession. \n\nIf you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.  \n\nIf you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead. \n\n\nRecuperating\n\n\nYou can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.  \n\nAfter three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:\n\n\n\n\nEnd one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.\n\n\nFor the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.\n\n\n\n\nResearching\n\n\nThe time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.  \n\nWhen you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.  \n\nFor each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses. \n\n\nTraining\n\n\nYou can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.  \n\nFirst, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.  \n\nThe training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.",

            "text": "Movement\n\n\nSwimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope--all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures. \n\nThe GM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: \"You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.\" Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: \"After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.\"  \n\nSometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over. \n\n\nSpeed\n\n\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day. \n\n\nTravel Pace\n\n\nWhile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.  \n\n\nForced March.\n The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.  \n\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.  \n\n\nMounts and Vehicles.\n For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.  \n\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.  \n\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a \ncarpet of flying\n, allow you to travel more swiftly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPace\n\n\nDistance per Minute\n\n\nDistance per Hour\n\n\nDistance per day\n\n\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast\n\n\n400 feet\n\n\n4 miles\n\n\n30 miles\n\n\n-5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal\n\n\n300 feet\n\n\n3 miles\n\n\n24 miles\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlow\n\n\n200 feet\n\n\n2 miles\n\n\n18 miles\n\n\nAble to use stealth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifficult Terrain\n\n\nThe travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground--all considered difficult terrain.  \n\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain--moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed--so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day. \n\n\nSpecial Types of Movement\n\n\nMovement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go. \n\n\nClimbing, Swimming, and Crawling\n\n\nWhile climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM\u2019s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check. \n\n\nJumping\n\n\nYour Strength determines how far you can jump.  \n\n\nLong Jump.\n When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.  \n\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.  \n\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.  \n\n\nHigh Jump.\n When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.  \n\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.",

It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.  \n\nMany spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn. \n\n\nThe Material Plane\n\n\nThe Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.  \n\nThe worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned. \n\n\nBeyond the Material\n\n\nBeyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They're not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world. \n\n\nPlanar Travel\n\n\nWhen adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.  \n\nTravel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.  \n\n\nSpells.\n A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. \nPlane shift\n and \ngate\n can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. \nEtherealness\n allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches--such as the Elemental Planes. And the \nastral projection\n spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.  \n\n\nPortals.\n A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations-- circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns--that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water). \n\n\nTransitive Planes\n\n\nThe Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as \netherealness\n and \nastral projection\n allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.  \n\nThe \nEthereal Plane\n is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the \nsee invisibility\n and \ntrue seeing\n spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as \nforcecage\n and \nwall of force\n. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.  \n\nThe \nAstral Plane\n is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain. \n\n\nInner Planes\n\n\nThe Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four \nElemental Planes\n--Air, Earth, Fire, and Water--form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning \nElemental Chaos\n.  \n\nAt their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form--great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos. \n\n\nOuter Planes\n\n\nIf the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.  \n\nWhen discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally \"places\" at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.  \n\nEven in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.  \n\nDistance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day--if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.  \n\nThe most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them. \n\n\nOuter Planes\n\n\nThe planes with some element of good in their nature are called the \nUpper Planes\n. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the \nLower Planes\n. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't match the plane's experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable. \n\n\nDemiplanes\n\n\nDemiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don't seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as \ndemiplane\n, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a \nplane shift\n spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The \ngate\n spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.",

            "text": "The Environment\n\n\nBy its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places. \n\n\nFalling\n\n\nA fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall. \n\n\nSuffocating\n\n\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).  \n\nWhen a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.  \n\nFor example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points. \n\n\nVision and Light\n\n\nThe most fundamental tasks of adventuring--noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few--rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.  \n\nA given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a \nlightly obscured\n area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. \n\nA \nheavily obscured\n area--such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage--blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.    \n\n\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness. \n\n\nBright light\n lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.  \n\n\nDim light\n, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.  \n\n\nDarkness\n creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness. \n\n\nBlindsight\n\n\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense. \n\n\nDarkvision\n\n\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. \n\n\nTruesight\n\n\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.  \n\nFurthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane. \n\n\nFood and Water\n\n\nCharacters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount. \n\n\nFood\n\n\nA character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food. \n\nA character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero. \n\n\nWater\n\n\nA character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. \n\nIf the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case. \n\n\nInteracting with Objects\n\n\nA character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.  \n\nFor example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.  \n\nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.  \n\nA character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.",

            "text": "The most fundamental tasks of adventuring--noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few--rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.   \nA given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a  lightly obscured  area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.  \nA  heavily obscured  area--such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage--blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.      The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.   Bright light  lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.    Dim light , also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.    Darkness  creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.",

If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.   \nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.   \nA character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.",

            "text": "Adventuring Gear\n\n\nThis section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.   \n\n\nAcid.\n As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.  \n\n\nAlchemist's Fire.\n This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.  \n\n\nAntitoxin.\n A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.  \n\n\nArcane Focus.\n An arcane focus is a special item--an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item--designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.  \n\n\nBall Bearings.\n As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.  \n\n\nBlock and Tackle.\n A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.  \n\n\nBook.\n A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).  \n\n\nCaltrops.\n As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.  \n\n\nCandle.\n For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. \n\n\nCase, Crossbow Bolt.\n This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts. \n\n\nCase, Map or Scroll.\n This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.  \n\n\nChain.\n A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check. \n\n\nClimber's Kit.\n A climber's kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber's kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can't fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can't climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor. \n\n\nComponent Pouch.\n A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description). \n\n\nCrowbar.\n Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar's leverage can be applied. \n\n\nDruidic Focus.\n A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus. \n\n\nFishing Tackle.\n This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting. \n\n\nHealer's Kit.\n This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. \n\n\nHoly Symbol.\n A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield. \n\n\nHoly Water.\n As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. \n\nA cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.  \n\n\nHunting Trap.\n When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.  \n\n\nLamp.\n A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. \n\n\nLantern, Bullseye.\n A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. \n\n\nLantern, Hooded.\n A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.  \n\n\nLock.\n A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices. \n\n\nMagnifying Glass.\n This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed. \n\n\nManacles.\n These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points. \n\n\nMess Kit.\n This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl. \n\n\nOil.\n Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. \n\n\nPoison, Basic.\n You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying. \n\n\nPotion of Healing.\n A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action. \n\n\nPouch.\n A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). \n\n\nQuiver.\n A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. \n\n\nRam, Portable.\n You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check. \n\n\nRations.\n Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts. \n\n\nRope.\n Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check. \n\n\nScale, Merchant's.\n A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth. \n\n\nSpellbook.\n Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells. \n\n\nSpyglass.\n Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size. Tent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two. \n\n\nTinderbox.\n This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch--or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel--takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute. \n\n\nTorch.\n A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.\n\n\nAdventuring Gear Tables\n\n\nAmmunition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nCost\n\n\nWeight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrows

            "text": "This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.     Acid.  As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.    Alchemist's Fire.  This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.    Antitoxin.  A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.    Arcane Focus.  An arcane focus is a special item--an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item--designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.    Ball Bearings.  As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.    Block and Tackle.  A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.    Book.  A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).    Caltrops.  As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.    Candle.  For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.   Case, Crossbow Bolt.  This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.   Case, Map or Scroll.  This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.    Chain.  A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.   Climber's Kit.  A climber's kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber's kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can't fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can't climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.   Component Pouch.  A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description).   Crowbar.  Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar's leverage can be applied.   Druidic Focus.  A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.   Fishing Tackle.  This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.   Healer's Kit.  This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.   Holy Symbol.  A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.   Holy Water.  As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.  \nA cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.    Hunting Trap.  When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.    Lamp.  A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.   Lantern, Bullseye.  A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.   Lantern, Hooded.  A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.    Lock.  A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.   Magnifying Glass.  This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.   Manacles.  These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.   Mess Kit.  This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.   Oil.  Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.   Poison, Basic.  You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.   Potion of Healing.  A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.   Pouch.  A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).   Quiver.  A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.   Ram, Portable.  You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.   Rations.  Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.   Rope.  Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.   Scale, Merchant's.  A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.   Spellbook.  Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.   Spyglass.  Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size. Tent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.   Tinderbox.  This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch--or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel--takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.   Torch.  A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.",

            "text": "Armor\n\n\nFantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.  \n\nThe Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.  \n\n\nArmor Proficiency.\n Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.   \n\n\nArmor Class (AC).\n Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class. \n\n\nHeavy Armor.\n Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows \"Str 13\" or \"Str 15\" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.  \n\n\nStealth.\n If the Armor table shows \"Disadvantage\" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.   \n\n\nShields.\n A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time. \n\n\nLight Armor\n\n\nMade from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.  \n\n\nPadded.\n Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.  \n\n\nLeather.\n The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.   \n\n\nStudded Leather.\n Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes. \n\n\nMedium Armor\n\n\nMedium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.  \n\n\nHide.\n This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.  \n\n\nChain Shirt.\n Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.   \n\n\nScale Mail.\n This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.  \n\n\nBreastplate.\n This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.   \n\n\nHalf Plate.\n Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps. \n\n\nHeavy Armor\n\n\nOf all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.  \n\nHeavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.  \n\n\nRing Mail.\n This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armor.   \n\n\nChain Mail.\n Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.  \n\n\nSplint.\n This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.   \n\n\nPlate.\n Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.\n\n\nArmor Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight Armor\n\n\nCost\n\n\nArmor Class (AC)\n\n\nStrength\n\n\nStealth\n\n\nWeight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPadded\n\n\n5 gp\n\n\n11 + Dex modifier\n\n\n-\n\n\nDisadvantage\n\n\n8 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeather\n\n\n10 gp\n\n\n11 + Dex modifier\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n10 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudded leather\n\n\n45 gp\n\n\n12 + Dex modifier\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n13 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium Armor\n\n\nCost\n\n\nArmor Class (AC)\n\n\nStrength\n\n\nStealth\n\n\nWeight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n10 gp\n\n\n12 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n12 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChain shirt\n\n\n50 gp\n\n\n13 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n20 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale mail\n\n\n50 gp\n\n\n14 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n\n\n-\n\n\nDisadvantage\n\n\n45 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreastplate\n\n\n400 gp\n\n\n14 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n20 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf plate\n\n\n750 gp\n\n\n15 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n\n\n-\n\n\nDisadvantage\n\n\n40 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavy  Armor\n\n\nCost\n\n\nArmor Class (AC)\n\n\nStrength\n\n\nStealth\n\n\nWeight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRing mail\n\n\n30 gp\n\n\n14\n\n\n-\n\n\nDisadvantage\n\n\n40 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChain mail\n\n\n75 gp\n\n\n16\n\n\nStr 13\n\n\nDisadvantage\n\n\n55 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplint\n\n\n200 gp\n\n\n17\n\n\nStr 15\n\n\nDisadvantage\n\n\n60 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate\n\n\n1,500 gp\n\n\n18\n\n\nStr 15\n\n\nDisadvantage\n\n\n65 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShield\n\n\nCost\n\n\nArmor Class (AC)\n\n\nStrength\n\n\nStealth\n\n\nWeight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShield\n\n\n10 gp\n\n\n+2\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n6  lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Into and Out of Armor\n\n\nThe time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.  \n\n\nDon.\n This is the time it takes to put on armor.

            "text": "Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.   \nThe Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.    Armor Proficiency.  Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.     Armor Class (AC).  Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.   Heavy Armor.  Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows \"Str 13\" or \"Str 15\" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.    Stealth.  If the Armor table shows \"Disadvantage\" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.     Shields.  A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.",

            "text": "Mounts and Vehicles\n\n\nA good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal\u2019s speed and base carrying capacity.  \n\nAn animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.  \n\nMounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.  \n\n\nBarding.\n Barding is armor designed to protect an animal\u2019s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.  \n\n\nSaddles.\n A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount. \n\n\nVehicle Proficiency.\n If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.  \n\n\nRowed Vessels.\n Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers.

            "text": "A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal\u2019s speed and base carrying capacity.   \nAn animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.   \nMounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.    Barding.  Barding is armor designed to protect an animal\u2019s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.    Saddles.  A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.   Vehicle Proficiency.  If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.    Rowed Vessels.  Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can\u2019t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.",

The table shows examples of the most common types of tools, each providing items related to a single craft.

            "text": "Weapons\n\n\nYour class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.  \n\nThe Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A \nmelee weapon\n is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a \nranged weapon\n is used to attack a target at a distance.    \n\n\nWeapon Proficiency\n\n\nYour race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are \nsimple\n and \nmartial\n. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.  \n\nProficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. \n\n\nWeapon Properties\n\n\nMany weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.  \n\n\nAmmunition.\n You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.   \n\nIf you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see \"Improvised Weapons\" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.  \n\n\nFinesse.\n When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. \n\n\nHeavy.\n Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.  \n\n\nLight.\n A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.  \n\n\nLoading.\n Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.  \n\n\nRange.\n A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.  \n\n\nReach.\n This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.  \n\n\nSpecial.\n A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see \"Special Weapons\" later in this section).  \n\n\nThrown.\n If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.  \n\n\nTwo-Handed.\n This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.  \n\n\nVersatile.\n This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property--the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack. \n\n\nImprovised Weapons\n\n\nSometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.  \n\nOften, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.  \n\nAn object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. \n\n\nSilvered Weapons\n\n\nSome monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective. \n\n\nSpecial Weapons\n\n\nWeapons with special rules are described here.  \n\n\nLance.\n You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.  \n\n\nNet.\n A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.  \n\nWhen you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\n\n\nWeapons Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Melee Weapons\n\n\nCost\n\n\nDamage\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nProperties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClub\n\n\n1 sp\n\n\n1d4 bludgeoning\n\n\n2 lb.\n\n\nLight\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDagger\n\n\n2 gp\n\n\n1d4 piercing\n\n\n1 lb.\n\n\nFinesse, light, thrown (range 20/60)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatclub\n\n\n2 sp\n\n\n1d8 bludgeoning\n\n\n10 lb.\n\n\nTwo-handed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandaxe\n\n\n5 gp\n\n\n1d6 slashing\n\n\n2 lb.\n\n\nLight, thrown (range 20/60)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavelin\n\n\n5 sp\n\n\n1d6 piercing\n\n\n2 lb.\n\n\nThrown (range 30/120)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight hammer\n\n\n2 gp\n\n\n1d4 bludgeoning\n\n\n2 lb.\n\n\nLight, thrown (range 20/60)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMace\n\n\n5 gp\n\n\n1d6 bludgeoning\n\n\n4 lb.\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarterstaff\n\n\n2 sp\n\n\n1d6 bludgeoning\n\n\n4 lb.\n\n\nVersatile (1d8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSickle\n\n\n1 gp\n\n\n1d4 slashing\n\n\n2 lb.\n\n\nLight\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpear\n\n\n1 gp\n\n\n1d6 piercing\n\n\n3 lb.\n\n\nThrown (range 20/60), versatile (1d8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Ranged Weapons\n\n\nCost\n\n\nDamage\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nProperties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossbow, light\n\n\n25 gp\n\n\n1d8 piercing\n\n\n5 lb.\n\n\nAmmunition (range 80/320), loading, two-handed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDart\n\n\n5 cp\n\n\n1d4 piercing\n\n\n1/4 lb.\n\n\nFinesse, thrown (range 20/60)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortbow\n\n\n25 gp\n\n\n1d6 piercing\n\n\n2 lb.\n\n\nAmmunition (range 80/320), two-handed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSling\n\n\n1 sp\n\n\n1d4 bludgeoning\n\n\n-\n\n\nAmmunition (range 30/120)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartial Melee Weapons\n\n\nCost\n\n\nDamage\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nProperties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattleaxe\n\n\n10 gp\n\n\n1d8 slashing\n\n\n4 lb.\n\n\nVersatile (1d10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlail\n\n\n10 gp\n\n\n1d8 bludgeoning\n\n\n2 lb.\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlaive\n\n\n20 gp\n\n\n1d10 slashing\n\n\n6 lb.\n\n\nHeavy, reach, two-handed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreataxe\n\n\n30 gp\n\n\n1d12 slashing\n\n\n7 lb.\n\n\nHeavy, two-handed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatsword\n\n\n50 gp\n\n\n2d6 slashing\n\n\n6 lb.\n\n\nHeavy, two-handed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalberd\n\n\n20 gp\n\n\n1d10 slashing\n\n\n6 lb.\n\n\nHeavy, reach, two-handed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLance\n\n\n10 gp\n\n\n1d12 piercing\n\n\n6 lb.\n\n\nReach, special\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongsword\n\n\n15 gp\n\n\n1d8 slashing\n\n\n3 lb.\n\n\nVersatile (1d10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaul\n\n\n10 gp\n\n\n2d6 bludgeoning\n\n\n10 lb.\n\n\nHeavy, two-handed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorningstar\n\n\n15 gp\n\n\n1d8 piercing\n\n\n4 lb.\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPike\n\n\n5 gp\n\n\n1d10 piercing\n\n\n18 lb.\n\n\nHeavy, reach, two-handed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRapier\n\n\n25 gp\n\n\n1d8 piercing\n\n\n2 lb.\n\n\nFinesse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScimitar\n\n\n25 gp\n\n\n1d6 slashing\n\n\n3 lb.\n\n\nFinesse, light\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortsword\n\n\n10 gp\n\n\n1d6 piercing\n\n\n2 lb.\n\n\nFinesse, light\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrident\n\n\n5 gp\n\n\n1d6 piercing\n\n\n4 lb.\n\n\nThrown (range 20/60), versatile (1d8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWar pick\n\n\n5 gp\n\n\n1d8 piercing\n\n\n2 lb.\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarhammer\n\n\n15 gp\n\n\n1d8 bludgeoning\n\n\n2 lb.\n\n\nVersatile (1d10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhip\n\n\n2 gp\n\n\n1d4 slashing\n\n\n3 lb.\n\n\nFinesse, reach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartial Ranged Weapons\n\n\nCost\n\n\nDamage\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nProperties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlowgun\n\n\n10 gp\n\n\n1 piercing\n\n\n1 lb.\n\n\nAmmunition (range 25/100), loading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossbow, hand\n\n\n75 gp\n\n\n1d6 piercing\n\n\n3 lb.\n\n\nAmmunition (range 30/120), light, loading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossbow, heavy\n\n\n50 gp\n\n\n1d10 piercing\n\n\n18 lb.\n\n\nAmmunition (range 100/400), heavy, loading, two-handed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongbow\n\n\n50 gp\n\n\n1d8 piercing\n\n\n2 lb.\n\n\nAmmunition (range 150/600), heavy, two-handed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet\n\n\n1 gp\n\n\n-\n\n\n3 lb.\n\n\nSpecial, thrown (range 5/15)",

Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.  \n\nThese brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment. \n\n\nLawful good (LG)\n creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.  \n\n\nNeutral good (NG)\n folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.  \n\n\nChaotic good (CG)\n creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good. \n\n\nLawful neutral (LN)\n individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.  \n\n\nNeutral (N)\n is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.  \n\n\nChaotic neutral (CN)\n creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.  \n\n\nLawful evil (LE)\n creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.  \n\n\nNeutral evil (NE)\n is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.  \n\n\nChaotic evil (CE)\n creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil. \n\n\nAlignment in the Multiverse\n\n\nFor many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.   \n\nThe evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god's influence.)  \n\nAlignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn't tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.  \n\nMost creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments - they are \nunaligned\n. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.",

            "text": "Backgrounds\n\n\nEvery story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.  \n\nChoosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character's identity. The most important question to ask about your background is \nwhat changed\n? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have \nmore\n money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?  \n\nThe sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions. \n\n\nProficiencies\n\n\nEach background gives a character proficiency in two skills. \n\nIn addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools.  \n\nIf a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead. \n\n\nLanguages\n\n\nSome backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race.\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\nEach background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background. \n\n\nSuggested Characteristics\n\n\nA background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation. Customizing a Background You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can't also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can't find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one. \n\n\nAcolyte\n\n\nYou have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric - performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.  \n\nChoose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in \"Fantasy--Historical Pantheons\" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny. \n\n\nSkill Proficiencies:\n Insight, Religion  \n\n\nLanguages:\n Two of your choice \n\nEquipment:\n A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp \n\n\nFeature: Shelter of the Faithful\n\n\nAs an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.  \n\nYou might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple. \n\n\nSuggested Characteristics\n\n\nAcolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd8\n\n\nPersonality Trait\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nI idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nI can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nI see omens in every event and action.

            "text": "Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\n\n\nThe Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our world's ancient times. They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game. \n\n\nThe Celtic Pantheon\n\n\nIt's said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak--and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.  \n\nThe Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere. \n\n\nThe Greek Pantheon\n\n\nThe gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence, and they've made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too. \n\n\nThe Egyptian Pantheon\n\n\nThese gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma'at--the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe.  \n\nThe Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning. \n\n\nThe Norse Pantheon\n\n\nWhere the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring--this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It's a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven't been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it's surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.  \n\nThe Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).\n\n\nCeltic

On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. \n\nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:\n\n\n\n\nYou have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\n\n\nWhen you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.\n\n\nYou have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. \n\n\n\n\nIf you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. \n\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. \n\nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. \n\n\nUnarmored Defense\n\n\n\n\nWhile you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.\n\n\nReckless Attack\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. \n\n\nDanger Sense\n\n\n\n\nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. \nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can\u2019t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. \n\n\nPrimal Path\n\n\n\n\nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. \n\n\nAbility Score Improvement\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u2019t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n\n\nExtra Attack\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n\n\nFast Movement\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren\u2019t wearing heavy armor. \n\n\nFeral Instinct\n\n\n\n\nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. \n\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn. \n\n\nBrutal Critical\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. \nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level. \n\n\nRelentless Rage\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. \n\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. \n\n\nPersistent Rage\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it. \n\n\nIndomitable Might\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total. \n\n\nPrimal Champion\n\n\n\n\nAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24. \n\n\nPath of the Berserker\n\n\n\n\nFor some barbarians, rage is a means to an end, that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being. \n\n\nFrenzy\n\n\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).\n\n\nMindless Rage\n\n\nBeginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage. \n\n\nIntimidating Presence\n\n\nBeginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (\nDC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.   \n\nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours. \n\n\nRetaliation\n\n\nStarting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.",

Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.\n\n\nCantrips\n\n\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table. \n\n\nSpell Slots\n\n\nThe Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u2019s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot. \n\n\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\n\n\nYou know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. \n\nThe Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. \n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.   \n\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\n\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n\n\n\n\nSpell save DC\n = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n\n\nSpell attack modifier\n = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n\n\n\n\nRitual Casting\n\n\nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. \n\n\nSpellcasting Focus\n\n\nYou can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. \n\n\nBardic Inspiration\n\n\n\n\nYou can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.\n\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. \n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. \n\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.   \n\n\nJack of All Trades\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn\u2019t already include your proficiency bonus. \n\n\nSong of Rest\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points. \n\nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level. \n\n\nBard College\n\n\n\n\nAt 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level. \n\n\nExpertise\n\n\n\n\nAt 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit. \n\n\nAbility Score Improvement\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u2019t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n\n\nFont of Inspiration\n\n\n\n\nBeginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest. \n\n\nCountercharm\n\n\n\n\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required). \n\n\nMagical Secrets\n\n\n\n\nBy 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.\n\nThe chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.\n\nYou learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level.  \n\n\nSuperior Inspiration\n\n\n\n\nAt 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use. \n\n\nCollege of Lore\n\n\n\n\nBards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.\n\nThe loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.\n\nThe college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority. \n\n\nBonus Proficiencies\n\n\nWhen you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice. \n\n\nCutting Words\n\n\nAlso at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed. \n\n\nAdditional Magical Secrets\n\n\nAt 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know. \n\n\nPeerless Skill\n\n\nStarting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.",

You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.  \nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class.

You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.\n\n\nPreparing and Casting Spells\n\n\nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u2019s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n\nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell \ncure wounds\n, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n\n\n\n\nSpell save DC\n = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n\nSpell attack modifier\n = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n\n\n\n\nRitual Casting\n\n\nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \n\n\nSpellcasting\n\n\nFocus You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. \n\n\nDivine Domain\n\n\n\n\nChoose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. \n\n\nDomain Spells\n\n\nEach domain has a list of spells\u2014its domain spells\u2014 that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn\u2019t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. \n\nIf you have a domain spell that doesn\u2019t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. \n\n\nChannel Divinity\n\n\n\n\nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. \n\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. \n\nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. \n\n\nChannel Divinity: Turn Undead\n\n\nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. \n\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\n\n\nAbility Score Improvement\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n\n\nDestroy Undead\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric Level\n\n\nDestroys Undead of CR...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\n1/2 or lower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8th\n\n\n1 or lower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11th\n\n\n2 or lower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14th\n\n\n3 or lower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17th\n\n\n4 or lower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivine Intervention\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. \n\nImploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. \n\nIf your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. \n\nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required. \n\n\nLife Domain\n\n\n\n\nThe Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy, one of the fundamental forces of the universe, that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).\n\n\nLife Domain Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric Level\n\n\nSpells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1st\n\n\nbless, cure wounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd\n\n\nlesser restoration, spiritual weapon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\nbeacon of hope, revivify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7th\n\n\ndeath ward, guardian of faith\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9th\n\n\nmass cure wounds, raise dead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus Proficiency\n\n\nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor. \n\n\nDisciple of Life\n\n\nAlso starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level. \n\n\nChannel Divinity: Preserve Life\n\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured. \n\nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct. \n\n\nBlessed Healer\n\n\nBeginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level. \n\n\nDivine Strike\n\n\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. \n\n\nSupreme Healing\n\n\nStarting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.",

Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic. \n\n\nSpellcasting\n\n\n\n\nDrawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.\n\n\nCantrips\n\n\nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. \n\n\nPreparing and Casting Spells\n\n\nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell \ncure wounds\n, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n\nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n\n\n\n\nSpell save DC\n = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n\n\nSpell attack modifier\n = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n\n\n\n\nRitual Casting\n\n\nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \n\n\nSpellcasting Focus\n\n\nYou can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, \u201cEquip- ment\u201d) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. \n\n\nWild Shape\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. \n\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.\n\n\nBeast Shapes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\nMax. CR\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2nd\n\n\n1/4\n\n\nNo flying or swimming speed\n\n\nWolf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4th\n\n\n1/2\n\n\nNo flying speed\n\n\nCrocodile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8th\n\n\n1\n\n\n-\n\n\nGiant Eagle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. \n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:  \n\n\n\n\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them. \n\n\nWhen you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.\n\n\nYou can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as \ncall lightning\n, that you've already cast. \n\n\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\n\n\nYou choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. \n\n\n\n\nDruid Circle\n\n\n\n\nAt 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n\n\nAbility Score Improvement\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n\n\nTimeless Body\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. \n\n\nBeast Spells\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components. \n\n\nArchdruid\n\n\n\n\nAt 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. \n\nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape. \n\n\nCircle of the Land\n\n\n\n\nThe Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites. \n\n\nBonus Cantrip\n\n\nWhen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. \n\n\nNatural Recovery\n\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. \n\nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots. \n\n\nCircle Spells\n\n\nYour mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land - arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp - and consult the associated list of spells.\n\nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn\u2019t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.\n\n\nArctic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid Level\n\n\nCircle Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd\n\n\nhold person, spike growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\nsleet storm, slow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7th\n\n\nfreedom of movement, ice storm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9th\n\n\ncommune with nature, cone of cold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid Level\n\n\nCircle Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd\n\n\nmirror image, misty step\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\nwater breathing, water walk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7th\n\n\ncontrol water, freedom of movement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9th\n\n\nconjure elemental, scrying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid Level\n\n\nCircle Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd\n\n\nblur, silence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\ncreate food and water, protection from energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7th\n\n\nblight, hallucinatory terrain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9th\n\n\ninsect plague, wall of stone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid Level\n\n\nCircle Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd\n\n\nbarkskin, spider climb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\ncall lightening, plant growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7th\n\n\ndivination, freedom of movement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9th\n\n\ncommune with nature, tree stride\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrassland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid Level\n\n\nCircle Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd\n\n\ninvisibility, pass without trace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\ndaylight, haste\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7th\n\n\ndivination, freedom of movement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9th\n\n\ndream, insect plague\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMountain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid Level\n\n\nCircle Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd\n\n\nspider climb, spike growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\nlightning bolt, meld into stone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7th\n\n\nstone shape, stoneskin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9th\n\n\npasswall, wall of stone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid Level\n\n\nCircle Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd\n\n\nacid arrow, darkness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\nwater walk, stinking cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7th\n\n\n_freedom of movement, locate creature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9th\n\n\ninsect plague, scrying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand\u2019s Stride\n\n\nStarting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. \n\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell. \n\n\nNature's Ward\n\n\nWhen you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease. \n\n\nNature's Sanctuary\n\n\nWhen you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. \n\n\n\n\nSacred Plants and Wood\n\n\nA druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. \n\nSimilarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. \n\nDruids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.\n\n\nDruids and the Gods\n\n\nSome druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse. The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.",

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.  \nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:     Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.   When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.  You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as  call lightning , that you've already cast.   You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.  You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.\n\n\nMartial Archetypes\n\n\nDifferent fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach. \n\n\nChampion\n\n\n\n\nThe archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows. \n\n\nImproved Critical\n\n\nBeginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. \n\n\nRemarkable Athlete\n\n\nStarting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn\u2019t already use your proficiency bonus. In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier. \n\n\nAdditional Fighting Style\n\n\nAt 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.\n\n\nSuperior Critical\n\n\nStarting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18\u201320. \n\n\nSurvivor\n\n\nAt 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don\u2019t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.",

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield: \n\n\n\n\nYou can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.\n\n\nYou can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.\n\n\nWhen you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.   \n\n\n\n\nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.\n\n\nKi\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. \n\nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. \n\nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. \n\nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature\u2019s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \n\n\n\n\nKi save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n\n\n\n\nFlurry of Blows\n\n\nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. \n\n\nPatient Defense\n\n\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. \n\n\nStep of the Wind\n\n\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.\n\n\nUnarmored Movement\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. \n\nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. \n\n\nMonastic Tradition\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. \n\n\nDeflect Missiles\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.\n\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. \n\n\nAbility Score Improvement\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n\n\nSlow Fall\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.\n\n\nExtra Attack\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n\n\nStunning Strike\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent\u2019s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. \n\n\nKi-Empowered Strikes\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. \n\n\nEvasion\n\n\n\n\nAt 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon\u2019s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. \n\n\nStillness of Mind\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened. \n\n\nPurity of Body\n\n\n\n\nAt 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison. \n\n\nTongue of the Sun and Moon\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say. \n\n\nDiamond Soul\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws. Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.\n\n\nTimeless Body\n\n\n\n\nAt 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can\u2019t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water. \n\n\nEmpty Body\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage. Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the \nastral projection\n spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can\u2019t take any other creatures with you. \n\n\nPerfect Self\n\n\n\n\nAt 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points. \n\n\nMonastic Traditions\n\n\nThree traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level. \n\n\nWay of the Open Hand\n\n\n\n\nMonks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm. \n\n\nOpen Hand Technique\n\n\nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:\n\n\n\n\nIt must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.  \n\n\nIt must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.  \n\n\nIt can\u2019t take reactions until the end of your next turn. \n\n\n\n\nWholeness of Body\n\n\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. \n\n\nTranquility\n\n\nBeginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a \nsanctuary\n spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. \n\n\nQuivering Palm\n\n\nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone\u2019s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage. \n\nYou can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.",

You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.  When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.      Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the \nhallow\n spell. \n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.\n\n\nLay on Hands\n\n\n\n\nYour blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level \u00d7 5. \n\nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. \n\nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. \n\nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs. \n\n\nFighting Style\n\n\n\n\nAt 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can\u2019t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. \n\n\nDefense\n\n\nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. \n\n\nDueling\n\n\nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. \n\n\nGreat Weapon Fighting\n\n\nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. \n\n\nProtection\n\n\nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. \n\n\nSpellcasting\n\n\n\n\nBy 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. \n\n\nPreparing and Casting Spells\n\n\nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell\u2019s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  \n\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell \ncure wounds\n, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.   \n\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\n\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n\n\n\n\nSpell save DC\n = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n\n\nSpell attack modifier\n = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n\n\n\n\nSpellcasting Focus\n\n\nYou can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells. \n\n\nDivine Smite\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon\u2019s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend. \n\n\nDivine Health\n\n\n\n\nBy 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease. \n\n\nSacred Oath\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now  you choose  an  oath,   such    as  the Oath    of  Devotion. \n\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature. \n\n\nOath Spells\n\n\nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don\u2019t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.  \n\nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you. \n\n\nChannel Divinity\n\n\nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.  \n\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.  \n\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC. \n\n\nAbility Score Improvement\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n\n\nExtra Attack\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n\n\nAura of Protection\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.  \n\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \n\n\nAura of Courage\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.  \n\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \n\n\nImproved Divine Smite\n\n\n\n\nBy 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite. \n\n\nCleansing Touch\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.  \n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. \n\n\nSacred Oaths\n\n\nBecoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.\n\n\nOath of Devotion\n\n\n\n\nThe Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels--the perfect servants of good--as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms. \n\n\nTenets of Devotion\n\n\nThough the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.  \n\n\nHonesty.\n Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.  \n\n\nCourage.\n Never fear to act, though caution is wise.  \n\n\nCompassion.\n Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.  \n\n\nHonor.\n Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.  \n\n\nDuty.\n Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you. \n\n\nOath Spells\n\n\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaladin Level\n\n\nSpells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd\n\n\nprotection from evil and good, sanctuary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\nlesser restoration, zone of truth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9th\n\n\nbeacon of hope, dispel magic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13th\n\n\nfreedom of movement, guardian of faith\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17th\n\n\ncommune, flame strike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChannel Divinity\n\n\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.    \n\n\nSacred Weapon.\n As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.  \n\nYou can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.  \n\n\nTurn the Unholy.\n As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.  \n\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can\u2019t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. \n\n\nAura of Devotion\n\n\nStarting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be charmed while you are conscious.  \n\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \n\n\nPurity of Spirit\n\n\nBeginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a \nprotection from evil and good\n spell. \n\n\nHoly Nimbus\n\n\nAt 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.  \n\nWhenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.   \n\nIn addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.   \n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n\n\n\nBreaking Your Oath\n\n\nA paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. \nA paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. \nIf a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM\u2019s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.",

Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.  \n\nYou have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.   \n\nWhen you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.   \n\nYou choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures. \n\n\nNatural Explorer\n\n\n\n\nYou are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.  \n\nWhile traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:\n\n\n\n\nDifficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel. \n\n\nYour group can't become lost except by magical means.\n\n\nEven when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.\n\n\nIf you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.\n\n\nWhen you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.\n\n\nWhile tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. \n\n\n\n\nYou choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level. \n\n\nFighting Style\n\n\n\n\nAt 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. \n\n\nArchery\n\n\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. \n\n\nDefense\n\n\nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. \n\n\nDueling\n\n\nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. \n\n\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\n\n\nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. \n\n\nSpellcasting\n\n\n\n\nBy the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. \n\n\nSpell Slots\n\n\nThe Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.   \n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell \nanimal friendship\n and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast \nanimal friendship\n using either slot. \n\n\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\n\n\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. \n\nThe Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.  \n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n\n\n\n\nSpell save DC\n = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n\nSpell attack modifier\n = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n\n\n\nRanger Archetype\n\n\n\n\nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. \n\n\nPrimeval Awareness\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number. \n\n\nAbility Score Improvement\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n\n\nExtra Attack\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n\n\nLand's Stride\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.  \n\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell. \n\n\nHide in Plain Sight\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.  \n\nOnce you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit. \n\n\nVanish\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail. \n\n\nFeral Senses\n\n\n\n\nAt 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.  \n\nYou are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened. \n\n\nFoe Slayer\n\n\n\n\nAt 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied. \n\n\nRanger Archetypes\n\n\nThe ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the Beast Master. \n\n\nHunter\n\n\n\n\nEmulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter's path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons. \n\n\nHunter's Prey\n\n\nAt 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\n\n\nColossus Slayer.\n Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.  \n\n\nGiant Killer.\n When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.   \n\n\nHorde Breaker.\n Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon. \n\n\nDefensive Tactics\n\n\nAt 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.    \n\n\nEscape the Horde.\n Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.  \n\n\nMultiattack Defense.\n When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.  \n\n\nSteel Will.\n You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. \n\n\nMultiattack\n\n\nAt 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. \n\n\nVolley.\n You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.  \n\n\nWhirlwind Attack.\n You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. \n\n\nSuperior Hunter's Defense\n\n\nAt 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. \n\n\nEvasion.\n When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.  \n\n\nStand Against the Tide.\n When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.  \n\n\nUncanny Dodge.\n When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.",

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. \n\nAt 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit. \n\n\nSneak Attack\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.  \n\nYou don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.  \n\nThe amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. \n\n\nThieves' Cant\n\n\n\n\nDuring your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.  \n\nIn addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. \n\n\nCunning Action\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. \n\n\nRoguish Archetype\n\n\n\n\nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. \n\n\nAbility Score Improvement\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n\n\nUncanny Dodge\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you. \n\n\nEvasion\n\n\n\n\nBeginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an \nice storm\n spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. \n\n\nReliable Talent\n\n\n\n\nBy 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. \n\n\nBlindsense\n\n\n\n\nStarting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. \n\n\nSlippery Mind\n\n\n\n\nBy 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. \n\n\nElusive\n\n\nBeginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated. \n\n\nStroke of Luck\n\n\n\n\nAt 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. \n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. \n\n\nRoguish Archetypes\n\n\nRogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus - not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques. \n\n\nThief\n\n\n\n\nYou hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ. \n\n\nFast Hands\n\n\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action. \n\n\nSecond-Story Work\n\n\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.  \n\nIn addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier. \n\n\nSupreme Sneak\n\n\nStarting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn. \n\n\nUse Magic Device\n\n\nBy 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items. \n\n\nThief's Reflexes\n\n\nWhen you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.",

This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. \n\n\nCantrips\n\n\nAt 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table. \n\n\nSpell Slots\n\n\nThe Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.   \n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell \nburning hands\n and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast \nburning hands\n using either slot. \n\n\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\n\n\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.  \n\nThe Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.   \n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\n\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n\n\n\n\nSpell save DC\n = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n\n\nSpell attack modifier\n = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n\n\n\n\nSpellcasting Focus\n\n\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells. \n\n\nSorcerous Origin\n\n\n\n\nChoose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description.  \n\nYour choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level. \n\n\nFont of Magic\n\n\n\n\nAt 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects. \n\n\nSorcery Points\n\n\nYou have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest. \n\n\nFlexible Casting\n\n\nYou can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.  \n\n\nCreating Spell Slots.\n You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.  \n\nAny spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell Slot Level\n\n\nSorcery Point Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1st\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2nd\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4th\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.\n As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level. \n\n\nMetamagic\n\n\n\n\nAt 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.  \n\nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. \n\n\nCareful Spell\n\n\nWhen you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell. \n\n\nDistant Spell\n\n\nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell. \n\nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet. \n\n\nEmpowered Spell\n\n\nWhen you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. \n\nYou can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. \n\n\nExtended Spell\n\n\nWhen you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours. \n\n\nHeightened Spell\n\n\nWhen you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell. \n\n\nQuickened Spell\n\n\nWhen you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. \n\n\nSubtle Spell\n\n\nWhen you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components. \n\n\nTwinned Spell\n\n\nWhen you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).  \n\nTo be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, \nmagic missile\n and \nscorching ray\n aren't eligible, but \nray of frost\n and \nchromatic orb\n are. \n\n\nAbility Score Improvement\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n\n\nSorcerous Restoration\n\n\n\n\nAt 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest. \n\n\nSorcerous Origins\n\n\nDifferent sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic. \n\n\nDraconic Bloodline\n\n\n\n\nYour innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.\n\n\nDragon Ancestor\n\n\nAt 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDragon\n\n\nDamage Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack\n\n\nAcid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nLightning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrass\n\n\nFire\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBronze\n\n\nLightning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopper\n\n\nAcid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGold\n\n\nFire\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nPoison\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed\n\n\nFire\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilver\n\n\nCold\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite\n\n\nCold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check. \n\n\nDraconic Resilience\n\n\nAs magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.  \n\nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. \n\n\nElemental Affinity\n\n\nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour. \n\n\nDragon Wings\n\n\nAt 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.  \n\nYou can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them. \n\n\nDraconic Presence\n\n\nBeginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.",

Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n\n\nPact Magic\n\n\n\n\nYour arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. \n\n\nCantrips\n\n\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.\n\n\nSpell Slots\n\n\nThe Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.  \n\nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell \nthunderwave\n, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. \n\n\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\n\n\nAt 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.  \n\nThe Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.   \n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\n\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n\n\n\n\nSpell save DC\n = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n\n\nSpell attack modifier\n = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n\n\n\n\nSpellcasting Focus\n\n\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. \n\n\nEldritch Invocations\n\n\n\n\nIn your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.  \n\nAt 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.   \n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. \n\n\nPact Boon\n\n\n\n\nAt 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice. \n\n\nPact of the Chain\n\n\nYou learn the \nfind familiar\n spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.  \n\nWhen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.  \n\nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. \n\n\nPact of the Blade\n\n\nYou can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.   \n\nYour pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.   \n\nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. \n\n\nPact of the Tome\n\n\nYour patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.  \n\nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die. \n\n\nAbility Score Improvement\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n\n\nMystic Arcanum\n\n\n\n\nAt 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.  \n\nYou can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.  \n\nAt higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest. \n\n\nEldritch Master\n\n\n\n\nAt 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.\n\n\nEldritch Invocations\n\n\nIf an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. \n\n\nAgonizing Blast\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n \neldritch blast\n cantrip \n\n\nWhen you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit. \n\n\nArmor of Shadows\n\n\nYou can cast \nmage armor\n on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n\n\nAscendant Step\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n 9th level \n\n\nYou can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n\n\nBeast Speech\n\n\nYou can cast \nspeak with animals\n at will, without expending a spell slot. \n\n\nBeguiling Influence\n\n\nYou gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills. \n\n\nBewitching Whispers\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n 7th level \n\n\nYou can cast \ncompulsion\n once using a warlock spell slot.

Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.  \n\nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it. \n\n\nChains of Carceri\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature\n\n\nYou can cast \nhold monster\n at will\u2014targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental - without expending a spell slot or material components.

As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings. \n\n\nLifedrinker\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature \n\n\nWhen you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). \n\n\nMask of Many Faces\n\n\nYou can cast \ndisguise self\n at will, without expending a spell slot. \n\n\nMaster of Myriad Forms\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n 15th level \n\n\nYou can cast \nalter self\n at will, without expending a spell slot. \n\n\nMinions of Chaos\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n 9th level \n\n\nYou can cast \nconjure elemental\n once using a warlock spell slot.

Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return. \n\nSome patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals. \n\n\nThe Fiend\n\n\n\n\nYou have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths. \n\n\nExpanded Spell List\n\n\nThe Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell Level\n\n\nSpells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1st\n\n\nburning hands, command\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2nd\n\n\nblindness/deafness, scorching ray\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd\n\n\nfireball, stinking cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4th\n\n\nfire shield, wall of fire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\nflame strike, hallow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDark One's Blessing\n\n\nStarting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1). \n\n\nDark One's Own Luck\n\n\nStarting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.   \n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. \n\n\nFiendish Resilience\n\n\nStarting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance. \n\n\nHurl Through Hell\n\n\nStarting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.   \n\nAt the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.   \n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. \n\n\n\n\nYour Pact Boon\n\n\nEach Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron's nature.  \n\n\nPact of the Chain.\n Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One's nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.  \n\n\nPact of the Blade.\n If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.  \n\n\nPact of the Tome.\n Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.",

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. \n\n\nSpellbook\n\n\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n\n\nPreparing and Casting Spells\n\n\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  \n\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.   \n\nFor example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.   \n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\n\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n\n\n\n\nSpell save DC\n = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier \n\n\nSpell attack modifier\n = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier \n\n\n\n\nRitual Casting\n\n\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared. \n\n\nSpellcasting Focus\n\n\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. \n\n\nLearning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\n\n\nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook. \n\n\nArcane Recovery\n\n\n\n\nYou have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.   \n\nFor example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. \n\n\nArcane Tradition\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.   \n\nYour choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n\n\nAbility Score Improvement\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n\n\nSpell Mastery\n\n\n\n\nAt 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.  \n\nBy spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. \n\n\nSignature Spells\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.  \n\nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. \n\n\nArcane Traditions\n\n\nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.  \n\nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques. \n\n\nSchool of Evocation\n\n\n\n\nYou focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants. \n\n\nEvocation Savant\n\n\nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved. \n\n\nSculpt Spells\n\n\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. \n\n\nPotent Cantrip\n\n\nStarting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip. \n\n\nEmpowered Evocation\n\n\nBeginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast. \n\n\nOverchannel\n\n\nStarting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.  \n\nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. \n\n\n\n\nYour Spellbook\n\n\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.  \n\n\nCopying a Spell into the Book.\n When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.  \n\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.  \n\n\nReplacing the Book.\n You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.  \n\nIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. \n\nThe Book's Appearance.\n Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.",

In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.    Copying a Spell into the Book.  When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.   \nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.    Replacing the Book.  You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.   \nIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.  The Book's Appearance.  Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.",

(The Common word for such meditation is \"trance.\") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.   Languages.  You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.",

            "text": "Actions in Combat\n\n\nWhen you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.  \n\nWhen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure. \n\n\nAttack\n\n\nThe most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.  \n\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the \"Making an Attack\" section for the rules that govern attacks.  \n\nCertain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action. \n\n\nCast a Spell\n\n\nSpellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. \n\n\nDash\n\n\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.  \n\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash. \n\n\nDisengage\n\n\nIf you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn. \n\n\nDodge\n\n\nWhen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0. \n\n\nHelp\n\n\nYou can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.  \n\nAlternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage. \n\n\nHide\n\n\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the \"Unseen Attackers and Targets\" section later in this chapter.    \n\n\nReady\n\n\nSometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn. \n\nFirst, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include \"If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it,\" and \"If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.\"  \n\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.  \n\nWhen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the \nweb\n spell and ready \nmagic missile\n, your \nweb\n spell ends, and if you take damage before you release \nmagic missile\n with your reaction, your concentration might be broken. \n\n\nSearch\n\n\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check. \n\n\nUse an Object\n\n\nYou normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.",

            "location": "/combat/damage_and_healing/index.html", 
            "text": "Damage and Healing\n\n\nInjury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a \nfireball\n spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures. \n\n\nHit Points\n\n\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.  \n\nA creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.  \n\nWhenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points. \n\n\nDamage Rolls\n\n\nEach weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.  \n\nWhen attacking with a \nweapon\n, you add your ability modifier--the same modifier used for the attack roll--to the damage. A \nspell\n tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.  \n\nIf a spell or other effect deals damage to \nmore than one target\n at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts \nfireball\n or a cleric casts \nflame strike\n, the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast. \n\n\nCritical Hits\n\n\nWhen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.  \n\nFor example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well. \n\n\nDamage Types\n\n\nDifferent attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.  \n\nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.  \n\n\nAcid.\n The corrosive spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.  \n\n\nBludgeoning.\n Blunt force attacks--hammers, falling, constriction, and the like--deal bludgeoning damage. \n\n\nCold.\n The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage. \n\n\nFire.\n Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage. \n\n\nForce.\n Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including \nmagic missile\n and \nspiritual weapon\n. \n\n\nLightning.\n A \nlightning bolt\n spell and a blue dragon's breath deal lightning damage. \n\n\nNecrotic.\n Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as \nchill touch\n, withers matter and even the soul. \n\n\nPiercing.\n Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.  \n\n\nPoison.\n Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage.  \n\n\nPsychic.\n Mental abilities such as a psionic blast deal psychic damage. \n\n\nRadiant.\n Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's \nflame strike\n spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power. \n\n\nSlashing.\n Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage. \n\n\nThunder.\n A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the \nthunderwave spell\n, deals thunder damage. \n\n\nDamage Resistance and Vulnerability\n\n\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. \n\nIf a creature or an object has \nresistance\n to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has \nvulnerability\n to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it. \n\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.  \n\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters. \n\n\nHealing\n\n\nUnless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points, and magical methods such as a \ncure wounds\n spell or a \npotion of healing\n can remove damage in an instant.  \n\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.  \n\nA creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic such as the \nrevivify\n spell has restored it to life. \n\n\nDropping to 0 Hit Points\n\n\nWhen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\n\n\nInstant Death\n\n\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.  \n\nFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies. \n\n\nFalling Unconscious\n\n\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points. \n\n\nDeath Saving Throws\n\n\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.  \n\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.  \n\n\nRolling 1 or 20.\n When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.  \n\n\nDamage at 0 Hit Points.\n If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death. \n\n\nStabilizing a Creature\n\n\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.  \n\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.  \n\nA \nstable\n creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours. \n\n\nMonsters and Death\n\n\nMost GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.  \n\nMighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters. \n\n\nKnocking a Creature Out\n\n\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable. \n\n\nTemporary Hit Points\n\n\nSome spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.  \n\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.  \n\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.  \n\nHealing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.  \n\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.  \n\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.",

Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.   \nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.    Acid.  The corrosive spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.    Bludgeoning.  Blunt force attacks--hammers, falling, constriction, and the like--deal bludgeoning damage.   Cold.  The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage.   Fire.  Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.   Force.  Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including  magic missile  and  spiritual weapon .   Lightning.  A  lightning bolt  spell and a blue dragon's breath deal lightning damage.   Necrotic.  Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as  chill touch , withers matter and even the soul.   Piercing.  Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.    Poison.  Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage.    Psychic.  Mental abilities such as a psionic blast deal psychic damage.   Radiant.  Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's  flame strike  spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.   Slashing.  Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.   Thunder.  A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the  thunderwave spell , deals thunder damage.",

If a creature or an object has  vulnerability  to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.  \nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.   \nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.",

Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.   \nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.   \nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.   \nHealing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.   \nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you.

            "text": "Making an Attack\n\n\nWhether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure. \n\n\n1. Choose a target.\n Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.  \n\n\n2. Determine modifiers.\n The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.  \n\n\n3. Resolve the attack.\n You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.    \n\n\nIf there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack. \n\n\nAttack Rolls\n\n\nWhen you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block. \n\n\nModifiers to the Roll\n\n\nWhen a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block. \n\n\nAbility Modifier.\n The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.  \n\nSome spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.  \n\n\nProficiency Bonus.\n You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell. \n\n\nRolling 1 or 20\n\n\nSometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.  \n\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.  \n\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. \n\n\nUnseen Attackers and Targets\n\n\nCombatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.  \n\nWhen you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.  \n\nWhen a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden--both unseen and unheard--when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.\n\n\nRanged Attacks\n\n\nWhen you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack. \n\n\nRange\n\n\nYou can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.  \n\nIf a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.  \n\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range. \n\n\nRanged Attacks in Close Combat\n\n\nAiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't incapacitated. \n\n\nMelee Attacks\n\n\nUsed in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack. \n\nMost creatures have a 5-foot \nreach\n and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.  \n\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an \nunarmed strike\n: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes. \n\n\nOpportunity Attacks\n\n\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.  \n\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.  \n\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.    \n\n\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\n\n\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.  \n\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it. \n\n\n\n\nContests in Combat\n\n\nBattle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others. \n\n\n\n\nGrappling\n\n\nWhen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.  \n\nThe target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).  \n\n\nEscaping a Grapple.\n A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check. \n\n\nMoving a Grappled Creature.\n When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.    \n\n\nShoving a Creature\n\n\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.  \n\nThe target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.",

            "text": "Movement and Position\n\n\nIn combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.  \n\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.  \n\nYour movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving. \n\n\nBreaking Up Your Move\n\n\nYou can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet. \n\n\nMoving between Attacks\n\n\nIf you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again. \n\n\nUsing Different Speeds\n\n\nIf you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.  \n\nFor example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more. \n\n\nDifficult Terrain\n\n\nCombat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases--the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.  \n\nEvery foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.  \n\nLow furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain. \n\n\nBeing Prone\n\n\nCombatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A. You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.  \n\nTo move while prone, you must \ncrawl\n or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of\nmovement.\n\n\n\n\nInteracting with Objects\n\n\nAround You Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:\n\n\n\n\ndraw or sheathe a sword\n\n\nopen or close a door\n\n\nwithdraw a potion from your backpack\n\n\npick up a dropped axe\n\n\ntake a bauble from a table\n\n\nremove a ring from your finger\n\n\nstuff some food into your mouth \n\n\nplant a banner in the ground\n\n\nfish a few coins from your belt pouch\n\n\ndrink all the ale in a flagon\n\n\nthrow a lever or a switch\n\n\npull a torch from a sconce\n\n\ntake a book from a shelf you can reach\n\n\nextinguish a small flame\n\n\ndon a mask\n\n\npull the hood of your cloak up and over your head\n\n\nput your ear to a door\n\n\nkick a small stone\n\n\nturn a key in a lock\n\n\ntap the floor with a 10-foot pole\n\n\nhand an item to another character \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving Around Other Creatures\n\n\nYou can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you. \n\nWhether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.  \n\nIf you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter. \n\n\nFlying Movement\n\n\nFlying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the \nfly\n spell. \n\n\nCreature Size\n\n\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories. \n\n\nSize Categories\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize\n\n\nSpace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiny\n\n\n2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall\n\n\n5 by 5 ft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n5 by 5 ft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge\n\n\n10 by 10 ft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuge\n\n\n15 by 15 ft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGargantuan\n\n\n20 by 20 ft. or larger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace\n\n\nA creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5\u2010foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.  \n\nA creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.  \n\nBecause larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one. \n\n\nSqueezing into a Smaller Space\n\n\nA creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.",

            "text": "The Order of Combat\n\n\nA typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A \nround\n represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a \nturn\n. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other. \n\n\n\n\nCombat Step by Step\n\n\n1. Determine surprise.\n The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised. \n\n\n2. Establish positions.\n The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are--how far away and in what direction. \n\n\n3. Roll initiative.\n Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns. \n\n\n4. Take turns.\n Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order. \n\n\n5. Begin the next round.\n When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.    \n\n\n\n\nSurprise\n\n\nA band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.  \n\nThe GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.  \n\nIf you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't. \n\n\nInitiative\n\n\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.  \n\nThe GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.  \n\nIf a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first. \n\n\nYour Turn\n\n\nOn your turn, you can \nmove\n a distance up to your speed and \ntake one action\n. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed--sometimes called your walking speed--is noted on your character sheet. \n\nThe most common actions you can take are described in the \"Actions in Combat\" section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.  \n\nThe \"Movement and Position\" section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.  \n\nYou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in \"Actions in Combat.\" \n\n\nBonus Actions\n\n\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.  \n\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.  \n\nYou choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action. \n\n\nOther Activity on Your Turn\n\n\nYour turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.  \n\nYou can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.  \n\nYou can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action.

An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.  \n\nA simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of \nlesser restoration\n. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.  \n\nA disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell. \n\n\nSample Diseases\n\n\nThe diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign. \n\n\nCackle Fever\n\n\nThis disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: \"the shrieks.\"  \n\nSymptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until the disease is cured.  \n\nAny event that causes the infected creature great stress--including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare--forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.  \n\nAny humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.  \n\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter. \n\n\nSewer Plague\n\n\nSewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.  \n\nWhen a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.  \n\nIt takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.  \n\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease. \n\n\nSight Rot\n\n\nThis painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.  \n\nA beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a \u22121 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches \u22125, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as \nlesser restoration\n or \nheal\n.  \n\nSight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.",

If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face. \n\n\nGoing Mad\n\n\nVarious magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as \ncontact other plane\n and \nsymbol\n, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.  \n\nResisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. \n\n\nMadness Effects\n\n\nMadness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite.

            "text": "Magic Items\n\n\nMagic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner's capabilities in wondrous ways. \n\n\nAttunement\n\n\nSome magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if it has spell slots and uses that class's spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like.  \n\nWithout becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.  \n\nAttuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.  \n\nAn item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can't attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.  \n\nA creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed. \n\n\nWearing and Wielding\n\n\nItems Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.  \n\nIn most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust. For example, drow-made armor might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped folk.  \n\nWhen a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a creature with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear boots. \n\n\nMultiple Items of the Same Kind\n\n\nUse common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks. \n\n\nPaired Items\n\n\nItems that come in pairs--such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves--impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either. \n\n\nActivating an Item\n\n\nActivating some magic items requires a user to do something special, such as holding the item and uttering a command word. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation.  \n\nIf an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to activate the item. \n\n\nCommand Word\n\n\nA command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can't be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell. \n\n\nConsumables\n\n\nSome items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic. \n\n\nSpells\n\n\nSome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.  \n\nA magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability--perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature--your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply. \n\n\nCharges\n\n\nSome magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained.",

The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the \nPlayer's Handbook\n for more information on creature size and space. \n\n\nSize Categories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize\n\n\nSpace\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiny\n\n\n2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft.\n\n\nImp, sprite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall\n\n\n5 by 5 ft.\n\n\nGiant rat, goblin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n5 by 5 ft.\n\n\nOrc, werewolf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge\n\n\n10 by 10 ft.\n\n\nHippogriff, ogre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuge\n\n\n15 by 15 ft.\n\n\nFire giant, treant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGargantuan\n\n\n20 by 20 ft. or larger\n\n\nKraken, purple worm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModifying Creatures\n\n\nDespite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a \nvariant\n or \ntemplate\n, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating. \n\n\n\n\nType\n\n\nA monster's type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an \narrow of dragon slaying\n deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.  \n\nThe game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.  \n\n\nAberrations\n are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, and slaadi.  \n\n\nBeasts\n are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.  \n\n\nCelestials\n are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity.  \n\n\nCelestials\n include angels, couatls, and pegasi. Constructs are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.  \n\n\nDragons\n are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.  \n\n\nElementals\n are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.  \n\n\nFey\n are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.  \n\n\nFiends\n are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths. \n\n\nGiants\n tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.  \n\n\nHumanoids\n are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.  \n\n\nMonstrosities\n are monsters in the strictest sense--frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any other type.  \n\n\nOozes\n are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.  \n\n\nPlants\n in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.  \n\n\nUndead\n are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters. \n\n\nTags\n\n\nA monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the humanoid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag. \n\n\nAlignment\n\n\nA monster's alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. \n\nThe alignment specified in a monster's stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster's alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there's nothing stopping you.  \n\nSome creatures can have \nany alignment\n. In other words, you choose the monster's alignment. Some monster's alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.  \n\nMany creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are unaligned, which means they don't have an alignment. \n\n\nArmor Class\n\n\nA monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster's AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value. \n\n\nHit Points\n\n\nA monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.  \n\nA monster's hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 \u00d7 4\u00bd).  \n\nA monster's size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.\n\n\nHit Dice by Size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonster Size\n\n\nHit Die\n\n\nAverage HP per Die\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiny\n\n\nd4\n\n\n2 1/2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall\n\n\nd6\n\n\n3 1/2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nd8\n\n\n4 1/2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge\n\n\nd10\n\n\n5 1/2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuge\n\n\nd12\n\n\n6 1/2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGargantuan\n\n\nd20\n\n\n10 1/2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA monster's Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11). \n\n\nSpeed\n\n\nA monster's speed tells you how far it can move on its turn.  \n\nAll creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster's speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet. Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.    \n\n\nBurrow\n\n\nA monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can't burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so. \n\n\nClimb\n\n\nA monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn't need to spend extra movement to climb. \n\n\nFly\n\n\nA monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to \nhover\n, which makes them hard to knock out of the air. Such a monster stops hovering when it dies. \n\n\nSwim\n\n\nA monster that has a swimming speed doesn't need to spend extra movement to swim. \n\n\nAbility Scores\n\n\nEvery monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. \n\n\nSaving Throws\n\n\nThe Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn't easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don't have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.  \n\nA saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster's challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).\n\n\nProficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\nProficiency Bonus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/8\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/4\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/2\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n+2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n+3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n+3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n+3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n+3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n+4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n+4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n+4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n+4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n+5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n+5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n+5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n+5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n+6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n+6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n+6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n+6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n+7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n+7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n+7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n+7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n+8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n+8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n+8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n+8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n+9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n+9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkills\n\n\nThe Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.  \n\nA skill bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster's challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise. \n\n\nArmor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies\n\n\nAssume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.  \n\nFor example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither. \n\n\nVulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities\n\n\nSome creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions. \n\n\nSenses\n\n\nThe Senses entry notes a monster's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below. \n\n\nBlindsight\n\n\nA monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.  \n\nCreatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.  \n\nIf a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception. \n\n\nDarkvision\n\n\nA monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense. \n\n\nTremorsense\n\n\nA monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs, have this special sense. \n\n\nTruesight\n\n\nA monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range. \n\n\nLanguages\n\n\nThe languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can't speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A \"--\" indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language. \n\n\nTelepathy\n\n\nTelepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can't initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.  \n\nA telepathic monster doesn't need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can't initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.  \n\nA creature within the area of an \nantimagic field\n or in any other location where magic doesn't function can't send or receive telepathic messages.\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\nA monster's \nchallenge rating\n tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.  \n\nMonsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.  \n\nSome monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill. \n\n\nExperience Points\n\n\nThe number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner. Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.\n\n\nExperience Points by Challenge Rating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\nXP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n0 or 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/8\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/4\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/2\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n450\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n1,100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n1,800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n2,300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n2,900\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n3,900\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n5,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n5,900\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n7,200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n8,400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n10,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n11,500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n13,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n15,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n18,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n20,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n22,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n25,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n33,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n41,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n50,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n62,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n75,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n90,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n150,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n120,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n135,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n155,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Traits\n\n\nSpecial traits (which appear after a monster's challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation. \n\n\nInnate Spellcasting\n\n\nA monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can't be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster's challenge rating.  \n\nAn innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the \nlevitate\n spell, but the spell has a \"self only\" restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.  \n\nA monster's innate spells can't be swapped out with other spells. If a monster's innate spells don't require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them. \n\n\nSpellcasting\n\n\nA monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher. The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.  \n\nThe monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.  \n\nA monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level \nlightning bolt\n spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.  \n\nYou can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating. \n\n\nPsionics\n\n\nA monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn't require any components to cast its spells. \n\n\nActions\n\n\nWhen a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action. \n\n\nMelee and Ranged Attacks\n\n\nThe most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the \"weapon\" might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. \n\n\nCreature vs. Target.\n The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a \"target\" can be a creature or an object.  \n\n\nHit.\n Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the \"\nHit\n\" notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.  \n\n\nMiss.\n If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the \"\nMiss:\n\" notation. \n\n\nMultiattack\n\n\nA creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can't use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack. \n\n\nAmmunition\n\n\nA monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow. \n\n\nReactions\n\n\nIf a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent. \n\n\nLimited Usage\n\n\nSome special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.  \n\n\nX/Day.\n The notation \"X/Day\" means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, \"1/Day\" means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.  \n\n\nRecharge X\u2013Y.\n The notation \"Recharge X\u2013Y\" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest. \n\nFor example, \"Recharge 5\u20136\" means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.  \n\n\nRecharge after a Short or Long Rest.\n This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again. \n\n\nGrapple Rules for Monsters\n\n\nMany monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn't need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.  \n\nA creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster's stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster's Strength (Athletics) modifier. \n\n\nEquipment\n\n\nA stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.  \n\nYou can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster's equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance. If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.",

            "text": "A monster's type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an  arrow of dragon slaying  deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.   \nThe game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.    Aberrations  are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, and slaadi.    Beasts  are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.    Celestials  are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity.    Celestials  include angels, couatls, and pegasi. Constructs are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.    Dragons  are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.    Elementals  are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.    Fey  are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.    Fiends  are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.   Giants  tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.    Humanoids  are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.    Monstrosities  are monsters in the strictest sense--frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any other type.    Oozes  are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.    Plants  in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.    Undead  are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.",

This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated crawler. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.    Drow Poison (Injury).  This poison is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.    Essence of Ether (Inhaled).

Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.  \n\nMost sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.  \n\nSentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM's control. Any activated property of the item is under the item's control, not its wielder's. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder. \n\n\nCreating Sentient Magic Items\n\n\nWhen you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item's persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here. \n\n\nAbilities\n\n\nA sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item's abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest. \n\n\nCommunication\n\n\nA sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud.

As long as the wielder's use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties.

If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:  \n\n\n The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.\n\n The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.\n\n The item demands that its wielder pursue the item's goals to the exclusion of all other goals.\n\n The item demands to be given to someone else. \n\n\nIf its wielder refuses to comply with the item's wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:\n\n Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.\n\n Suppress one or more of its activated properties. \n* Attempt to take control of its wielder.\n\n\nIf a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can't use this power again until the next dawn.",

            "location": "/gamemaster_rules/traps/index.html", 
            "text": "Traps\n\n\nTraps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.  \n\nA trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. \nMechanical traps\n include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. \nMagic traps\n are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as \nglyph of warding\n and \nsymbol\n that function as traps. \n\n\nTraps in Play\n\n\nWhen adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it. \n\n\nTriggering a Trap\n\n\nMost traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap's creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the \nglyph of warding\n spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating. \n\n\nDetecting and Disabling a Trap\n\n\nUsually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap's presence.  \n\nA trap's description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap's DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves' tools to perform the necessary sabotage.  \n\nAny character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap's description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, \ndispel magic\n has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap's description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use \ndispel magic\n.  \n\nIn most cases, a trap's description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character's actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn't allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap's description to determine what happens. No trap's design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.  \n\nYou should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.  \n\nFoiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.  \n\nTraps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap. \n\n\nTrap Effects\n\n\nThe effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap's description specifies what happens when it is triggered.  \n\nThe attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap's severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.  \n\nA trap intended to be a \nsetback\n is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a \ndangerous\n trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A \ndeadly\n trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels. \n\n\nTrap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrap Danger\n\n\nSave DC\n\n\nAttack Bonus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetback\n\n\n10-11\n\n\n+3 to +5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDangerous\n\n\n12-15\n\n\n+6 to +8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadly\n\n\n16-20\n\n\n+9 to +12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamage Severity by Level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter Level\n\n\nSetback\n\n\nDangerous\n\n\nDeadly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1st-4th\n\n\n1d10\n\n\n2d10\n\n\n4d10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th-10th\n\n\n2d10\n\n\n4d10\n\n\n10d10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11th-16th\n\n\n4d10\n\n\n10d10\n\n\n18d10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17th-20th\n\n\n10d10\n\n\n18d10\n\n\n24d10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplex Traps\n\n\nComplex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.  \n\nWhen a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap's description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.  \n\nFor example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap's turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded. \n\n\nSample Traps\n\n\nThe magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order. \n\n\nCollapsing Roof\n\n\nMechanical trap\n \n\n\nThis trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.  \n\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.  \n\nAnyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.  \n\nThe ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it's in danger of collapse.  \n\nWhen the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain. \n\n\nFalling Net\n\n\nMechanical trap\n \n\n\nThis trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.  \n\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.  \n\nWhen the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section. \n\n\nFire-Breathing Statue\n\n\nMagic trap\n \n\n\nThis trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.  \n\nThe DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as \ndetect magic\n, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.  \n\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n\nWedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful \ndispel magic\n (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap. \n\n\nPits\n\n\nMechanical trap\n \n\n\nFour basic pit traps are presented here.  \n\n\nSimple Pit.\n A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit's edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.  \n\nThe DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit's depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).  \n\n\nHidden Pit.\n This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.  \n\nA successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit's cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.  \n\nWhen a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.  \n\nOnce the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit's cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the \narcane lock\n spell or similar magic.  \n\n\nLocking Pit.\n This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.  \n\nA successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.  \n\n\nSpiked Pit.\n This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. \n\n\nPoison Darts\n\n\nMechanical trap\n \n\n\nWhen a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.  \n\nThe tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.  \n\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don't hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. \n\n\nPoison Needle\n\n\nMechanical trap\n \n\n\nA poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest's lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.  \n\nWhen the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.  \n\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap's presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap. \n\n\nRolling Sphere\n\n\nMechanical trap\n \n\n\nWhen 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap's pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.  \n\nWith a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate's presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.  \n\nActivation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures' spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature's space or a creature enters its space while it's rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.  \n\nThe sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can't go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.  \n\nAs an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere's speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere's speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat. \n\n\nSphere of Annihilation\n\n\nMagic trap\n\n\nMagical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.  \n\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a \nsphere of annihilation\n that can't be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal \nsphere of annihilation\n.  \n\nSome versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the \nsympathy\n aspect of the \nantipathy/sympathy\n spell. A successful \ndispel magic\n (DC 18) removes this enchantment.",

            "text": "Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap's presence.   \nA trap's description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap's DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves' tools to perform the necessary sabotage.   \nAny character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap's description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition,  dispel magic  has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap's description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use  dispel magic .   \nIn most cases, a trap's description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character's actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn't allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap's description to determine what happens. No trap's design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.   \nYou should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.   \nFoiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.   \nTraps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.",

It is otherwise identical to a normal  sphere of annihilation .   \nSome versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the  sympathy  aspect of the  antipathy/sympathy  spell. A successful  dispel magic  (DC 18) removes this enchantment.",

The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:  \n\n\nArmor Class:\n 20  \n\n\nHit Points:\n 200  \n\n\nSpeed:\n 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)  \n\n\nDamage Immunities:\n poison, psychic \n\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.  \n\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet.

If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.   \nPlacing a  bag of holding  inside an extradimensional space created by a  handy haversack ,  portable hole , or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.  \n\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.  \n\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.  \n\n\nBronze Griffon (Rare).\n This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.  \n\n\nEbony Fly (Rare).\n This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness of a horsefly.

You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.  \n\n\nIvory Goats (Rare).\n These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe \ngoat of traveling\n can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.   \n\n\nThe \ngoat of travail\n becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.\n\n\nThe \ngoat of terror\n becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a \n+1 lance\n, and the other becomes a \n+2 longsword\n. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.    \n\n\n\n\nMarble Elephant (Rare).\n This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.  \n\n\nObsidian Steed (Very Rare).\n This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.  \n\nIf you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.   \n\n\nOnyx Dog (Rare).\n This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range.

            "text": "Wondrous item, rarity by figurine    A  figurine of wondrous power  is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.   \nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.   \nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.    Bronze Griffon (Rare).

These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.    Ivory Goats (Rare).  These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:   The  goat of traveling  can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.     The  goat of travail  becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.  The  goat of terror  becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a  +1 lance , and the other becomes a  +2 longsword . Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.

A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.  \n\nIf you press \nbutton 1\n, the rod becomes a \nflame tongue\n, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head.  \n\nIf you press \nbutton 2\n, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.  \n\nIf you press \nbutton 3\n, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.  \n\nIf you press \nbutton 4\n, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.  \n\nIf you press \nbutton 5\n, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.  \n\nIf you press \nbutton 6\n, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.  \n\n\nDrain Life.\n When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.  \n\n\nParalyze.\n When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.  \n\n\nTerrify.\n While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Hit:  12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.    Tentacle.   Melee Weapon Attack:  +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  Hit:  7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13) and restrained until the grapple ends. The otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.    Tentacle Slam.

            "text": "Expenses\n\n\nWhen not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others. \n\n\nLifestyle Expenses\n\n\nLifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.  \n\nAt the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.  \n\nYour lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLifestyle\n\n\nPrice/Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWretched\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSqualid\n\n\n1 sp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoor\n\n\n2 sp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModest\n\n\n1 gp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComfortable\n\n\n2 gp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWealthy\n\n\n4 gp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAristocratic\n\n\n10 gp minimum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWretched.\n You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.  \n\n\nSqualid.\n You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.  \n\n\nPoor.\n A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.  \n\n\nModest.\n A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.  \n\n\nComfortable.\n Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.  \n\n\nWealthy.\n Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.  \n\n\nAristocratic.\n You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.\n\n\nSelf-Sufficiency\n\n\nThe expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford--paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.  \n\nMaintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.\n\n\nFood, Drink, and Lodging\n\n\nThe Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night's lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.\n\n\nFood and Drink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nCost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAle (gallon)\n\n\n2 sp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAle (mug)\n\n\n4 cp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanquet (per person)\n\n\n10 gp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBread, loaf\n\n\n2 cp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheese, hunk\n\n\n1 sp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeat, chunk\n\n\n3 sp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWine, common (pitcher)\n\n\n2 sp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWine, fine (bottle)\n\n\n10 gp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeals and Lodging (per day)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nMeals Cost\n\n\nLodging Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSqualid\n\n\n3 cp\n\n\n7 cp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoor\n\n\n6 cp\n\n\n1 sp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModest\n\n\n3 sp\n\n\n5 sp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComfortable\n\n\n5 sp\n\n\n8 sp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWealthy\n\n\n8 sp\n\n\n2 gp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAristocratic\n\n\n2 gp\n\n\n4 gp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\n\nAdventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.  \n\nSome of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.  \n\nOther hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService\n\n\nPay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoach cab (Between towns)\n\n\n3 cp per mile\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoach cab (Within a city)\n\n\n1 cp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHireling (Skilled)\n\n\n2 gp per day\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHireling (Untrained)\n\n\n2 sp per day\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessenger\n\n\n2 cp per mile\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoad or gate toll\n\n\n1 cp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShip's passage\n\n\n1 sp per mile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers. \n\n\nSpellcasting Services\n\n\nPeople who are able to cast spells don't fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.  \n\nHiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as \ncure wounds\n or \nidentify\n, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment--the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.",

A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called \ngaining a level\n.  \n\nWhen your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can\u2019t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.  \n\nEach time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).  \n\nWhen your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 18, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4.

            "text": "As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called  gaining a level .   \nWhen your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can\u2019t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.   \nEach time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).   \nWhen your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.

            "text": "Multiclassing\n\n\nMulticlassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.  \n\nWith this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.  \n\nAs you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility. \n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nTo qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass\n\n\nAbility Score Minimum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarbarian\n\n\nStrength 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBard\n\n\nCharisma 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric\n\n\nWisdom 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid\n\n\nWisdom 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFighter\n\n\nStrength 13 or Dexterity 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonk\n\n\nDexterity 13 and Wisdom 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaladin\n\n\nStrength 13 and Charisma 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRanger\n\n\nDexterity 13 and Wisdom 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRogue\n\n\nDexterity 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorcerer\n\n\nCharisma 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarlock\n\n\nCharisma 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWizard\n\n\nIntelligence 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperience Points\n\n\nThe experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric. \n\n\nHit Points and Hit Dice\n\n\nYou gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.  \n\nYou add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice. \n\n\nProficiency Bonus\n\n\nYour proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3. \n\n\nProficiencies\n\n\nWhen you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.\n\n\nMulticlassing Proficiencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass\n\n\nProficiencies Gained\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarbarian\n\n\nShields, simple weapons, martial weapons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBard\n\n\nLight armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric\n\n\nLight armor, medium armor, shields\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDruid\n\n\nLight armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not ear armor or use shields made of metal)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFighter\n\n\nLight armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonk\n\n\nSimple weapons, shortswords\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaladin\n\n\nLight armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRanger\n\n\nLight armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class's skill list\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRogue\n\n\nLight armor, one skill from the class's skill list, thieves' tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorcerer\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarlock\n\n\nLight armor, simple weapons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWizard\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass Features\n\n\nWhen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting. \n\n\nChannel Divinity\n\n\nIf you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes. \n\n\nExtra Attack\n\n\nIf you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack. \n\n\nUnarmored Defense\n\n\nIf you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class. \n\n\nSpellcasting\n\n\nYour capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.  \n\n\nSpells Known and Prepared.\n You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.  \n\nEach spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.  \n\n\nSpell Slots.\n You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.  \n\nIf you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like \nburning hands\n, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.  \n\nFor example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know \u2014 and potentially enhance their effects.  \n\n\nPact Magic.\n If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\n\n\nMulticlass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\n1st\n\n\n2nd\n\n\n3rd\n\n\n4th\n\n\n5th\n\n\n6th\n\n\n7th\n\n\n8th\n\n\n9th\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1st\n\n\n2\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2nd\n\n\n3\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3nd\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20th\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1",

Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.    Spells Known and Prepared.  You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.   \nEach spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.    Spell Slots.  You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.   \nIf you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like  burning hands , has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.   \nFor example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know \u2014 and potentially enhance their effects.    Pact Magic.  If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.",

            "text": "Ability Checks\n\n\nAn ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.  \n\nFor every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\n\n\nTypical Difficulty Classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Difficulty\n\n\nDC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery easy\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHard\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery hard\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly impossible\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success--the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.\n\n\nContests\n\n\nSometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal--for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest. \n\nBoth participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding. \n\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut. \n\n\nSkills\n\n\nEach ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.) \n\nFor example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding. \n\nThe skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability. \n\n\nStrength\n\n\n\n\nAthletics \n\n\n\n\nDexterity\n\n\n\n\nAcrobatics\n\n\nSleight of Hand \n\n\nStealth \n\n\n\n\nIntelligence\n\n\n\n\nArcana\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nInvestigation\n\n\nNature\n\n\nReligion \n\n\n\n\nWisdom\n\n\n\n\nAnimal Handling\n\n\nInsight\n\n\nMedicine\n\n\nPerception\n\n\nSurvival \n\n\n\n\nCharisma\n\n\n\n\nDeception\n\n\nIntimidation\n\n\nPerformance\n\n\nPersuasion \n\n\n\n\nSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill--for example, \u201cMake a Wisdom (Perception) check.\u201d At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.  \n\nFor example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check. \n\n\nVariant: Skills with Different Abilities\n\n\nNormally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-\u00ad\u2010\u2011orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma. \n\n\nPassive Checks\n\n\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.  \n\nHere's how to determine a character's total for a passive check: \n\n\n\n\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\n\n\n\n\nIf the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a \nscore\n. \n\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.  \n\nThe rules on hiding in the \u201cDexterity\u201d section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules. \n\n\nWorking Together\n\n\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort--or the one with the highest ability modifier--can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.  \n\nA character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help. \n\n\nGroup Checks\n\n\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.  \n\nTo make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.  \n\nOtherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.",

The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.  \n\n\nStealth.\n Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.  \n\n\nOther Dexterity Checks.\n The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n\n\n\n\nControl a heavily laden cart on a steep descent \n\n\nSteer a chariot around a tight turn\n\n\nPick a lock \n\n\nDisable a trap\n\n\nSecurely tie up a prisoner \n\n\nWriggle free of bonds \n\n\nPlay a stringed instrument \n\n\nCraft a small or detailed object \n\n\n\n\nAttack Rolls and Damage\n\n\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow.

Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat. \n\n\n\n\nHiding\n\n\nThe DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence. \n\nYou can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. \nAn invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet. \n\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen. \n\n\nPassive Perception.\n When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.

The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.  \n\n\nAthletics.\n Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming.

            "text": "Casting a Spell\n\n\nWhen a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the spell's effects.  \n\nEach spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect. \n\n\nCasting Time\n\n\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast. \n\n\nBonus Action\n\n\nA spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action. \n\n\nReactions\n\n\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so. \n\n\nLonger Casting Times\n\n\nCertain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over. \n\n\nRange\n\n\nThe target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like \nmagic missile\n, the target is a creature. For a spell like \nfireball\n, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.  \n\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the \nshield\n spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.  \n\nSpells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect must be you.  \n\nOnce a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise. \n\n\nComponents\n\n\nA spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the spell. \n\n\nVerbal (V)\n\n\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the \nsilence\n spell, can't cast a spell with a verbal component.\n\n\nSomatic (S)\n\n\nSpellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures. \n\n\nMaterial (M)\n\n\nCasting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a \ncomponent pouch\n or a \nspellcasting focus\n (found in \u201cEquipment\u201d) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.  \n\nIf a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell. A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material components--or to hold a spellcasting focus--but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components. \n\n\nDuration\n\n\nA spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed. \n\n\nInstantaneous\n\n\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant. \n\n\nConcentration\n\n\nSome spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.  \n\nIf a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).  \n\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n\n\n\n\nCasting another spell that requires concentration.\n You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.   \n\n\nTaking damage.\n Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.   \n\n\nBeing incapacitated or killed.\n You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.  \n\nThe GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell. \n\n\n\n\nTargets\n\n\nA typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below). \n\nUnless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise. \n\n\nA Clear Path to the Target\n\n\nTo target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover. If you place an area of effect at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction. \n\n\nTargeting Yourself\n\n\nIf a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself. Areas of Effect Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\n\n\nAreas of Effect\n\n\nSpells such as \nburning hands\n and \ncone of cold\n cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once. \n\nA spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a \npoint of origin\n, a location from which the spell's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.  \n\nA spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover. \n\n\nCone\n\n\nA cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.  \n\nA cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise. \n\n\nCube\n\n\nYou select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side.  \n\nA cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise. \n\n\nCylinder\n\n\nA cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.  \n\nA cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect. \n\n\nLine\n\n\nA line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.  \n\nA line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise. \n\n\nSphere\n\n\nYou select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.  \n\nA sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect. \n\n\nSaving Throws\n\n\nMany spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.  \n\nThe DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers. \n\n\nAttack Rolls\n\n\nSome spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.  \n\nMost spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated. \n\n\n\n\nThe Schools of Magic\n\n\nAcademies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.  \n\nThe schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.  \n\n\nAbjuration\n spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.  \n\n\nConjuration\n spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.  \n\n\nDivination\n spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places. \n\n\nEnchantment\n spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.  \n\n\nEvocation\n spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.  \n\n\nIllusion\n spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.  \n\n\nNecromancy\n spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.  \n\nCreating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.  \n\n\nTransmutation\n spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury. \n\n\n\n\nCombining Magical Effects\n\n\nThe effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect--such as the highest bonus--from those castings applies while their durations overlap. \n\nFor example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice.",

Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.   \nThe schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.    Abjuration  spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.    Conjuration  spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.    Divination  spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.   Enchantment  spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.    Evocation  spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.    Illusion  spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.    Necromancy  spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.   \nCreating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.    Transmutation  spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.",

In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect--in most cases, all in the span of seconds.  \n\nSpells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions, drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.  \n\nUncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse's history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so. \n\n\nSpell Level\n\n\nEvery spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) \nmagic missile\n at 1st level and the earth-shaking \nwish\n at 9th. Cantrips--simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote--are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.  \n\nSpell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell. \n\n\nKnown and Prepared Spells\n\n\nBefore a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.  \n\nIn every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character's level. \n\n\nSpell Slots\n\n\nRegardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher- level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class's description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots. \n\nWhen a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively \"filling\" a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size--small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts \nmagic missile\n, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.  \n\nFinishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.  \n\nSome characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way. \n\n\nCasting a Spell at a Higher Level\n\n\nWhen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts \nmagic missile\n using one of her 2nd-level slots, that \nmagic missile\n is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.  \n\nSome spells, such as \nmagic missile\n and \ncure wounds\n, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description. \n\n\n\n\nCasting in Armor\n\n\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\n\n\n\n\nCantrips\n\n\nA cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster's mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip's spell level is 0. \n\n\nRituals\n\n\nCertain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher level. \n\nTo cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character's ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard's does.",

The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher level.  \nTo cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character's ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard's does.",

If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.   Grasping Hand.  The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.   Interposing Hand.  The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.   At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.",

While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.  While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.       A  remove curse  spell ends this effect.

If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.  \n\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down.

The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.  \n\n\nRedirect Flow.\n You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions.

Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.   \nQuestions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.   \nYou can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.   \nOnce you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.",

While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.   \nWhen the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.   \nWhile your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.   \nYou can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.",

The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).   \nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.   \nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.   At Higher Levels.

You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.  \n\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure.
